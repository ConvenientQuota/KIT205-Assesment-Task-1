Hash Table with chaining vs Hash Table using Open Addressing

The goal of this project is to utilise a simple database system that'll use hash tables that will compare two different types of implementation.

These will be tested based on using different hash function and observing their impact on basic operation such as searching, deleting, insertion, and etc.
